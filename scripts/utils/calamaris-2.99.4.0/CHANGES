	* calamaris (2.57):

	  	* Holger Marzen <holger@marzen.de> requested an output-format which
	  	  he can use to parse afterwards. -F unformatted is the result.  if
	  	  you use -F unformatted along with -U, the byte values are calculated
	  	  in the given Unit, and displayed without indication along with the
	  	  numbers. the indication moves up to the header of the report.
	  	* as announced in the README i converted -m -w and -W also into the
	  	  new -F-switch. so you now have to use -F mail, -F html and -F
	  	  html-embed. For now the old switches will still work, but
	  	  Calamaris puts out warnings about that. The switches defunct in
	  	  the first release of '04.
	  	* I deleted (as scheduled) a warning about -N f which has been
	  	  replaced by -N -1

	  	+ fixed a bug in cache-file-writing. other-lines in host-related
	  	  sub-reports in the requester-reports were put out with a
	  	  missing field, which makes it impossible to read them in
	  	  again.  However:  this part of the reports is not the default
	  	  so this won't hit many users. I put a workaround in, which
	  	  normally should recover 'broken' cachefiles without data-loss.

	  * all warn-calls were replaced by print to STDERR, so get rid of the
	          automagically apended line-numbers.
	  * now Calamaris checks the syntax of Logfilelines a little more,
	          because lines such as 'if needed, or if running Squid for the first
	          time.' lead to strange errors. A correct line has to have a
	          date-field with the syntax \d+\.\d\d\d (reported by Gerold
	          Meerkoetter (gerold@noc.fh-lippe.de))
	  * if ident-information parsing is activated, but there isn't an
	  	ident-information available now the ouput is without the leading
	  	'-@'.  (patch by Chris Teakle (ccteakle@its.uq.edu.au))
	  * added new hierarchie-method 'ANY_PARENT'.
	  * added a small invisible Y2K-fix. Now Calamaris uses internal the
	  	correct 4-digit-year. However Calamaris only prints 2-digit-years
	  	because i want to produce lines which were max. 79 chars long.

	  	sometimes not.  (reported by John Line (webadm@info.cam.ac.uk))
	  * moved checking for -n also into the mainloop.
	  * moved CARP-Requests from the 'FETCH from Parent Cache' to the 'HIT
	  	on Sibling or Parent Cache'-section of the Outgoing-request-status.
	  	(Hope this is correct, but the Reports provided by Emmanuel Adeline
	  	(emmanuel.adeline@mail.dotcom.fr) look to me like this is the

	  * TIMEOUT_NONE is now recognized, Calamaris doesn't complain
	  anymore.
	  * added a HTML 4.0-header to the HTML-Report. (thanks to Iain Lea)
	  * Performance-Report corrected. ICP-Request are not counted anymore.
	  * Fixed a Y2K-Problem :-) Y2K has been reported as 100, which is
	    correct, but this breaks my 80-chars text-width, and it is not that
	    intuitive. Now Y2K will show up as 00. (Internal I calculate all

	    60k-line-file compared with V2.8). With bigger Logfiles the gain
	    should be greater. However: The Peakmeasurement is the less
	    efficient part of Calamaris, if you switch it off Calamaris will be
	    30% (with 60k-lines) or more faster. (I'm not glad with it, maybe
	    someone has an idea how to build a routine which is fast AND more
	  reliable?).
