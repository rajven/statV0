Calamaris
Version 3

What is it?
-----------

Calamaris is a Perl script, which was first intended as demo for a statistical
software for Squid.  I started it at 13 January 1997 (Version 1.1) as a
rewrite of my old Squid-Analysis-Script weekly.pl (which was in German
language). I announced it (Version 1.16) to the public at 28 Feb 1997.  (see
http://www.squid-cache.org/mail-archive/squid-users/199702/0551.html for the
Original-Announcement) Since then it is used by people all around the world,
and i decided to build a new improved version of it.  Calamaris V2 was a
nearly complete rewrite, with changed and more reports.

2004 Michael Pophal send me a jumbo-patch against Calamaris 2.59, which adds
two more reports, and the long wanted graphics to make your
mangle^H^H^Hagement happy.

Philipp Frauenfelder <pfrauenf@debian.org> has build a Debian Package, which
can be found via http://packages.debian.org/calamaris .

Is there anything else?
-----------------------

Ernst Heiri has build a spin-off of my Calamaris V1, which can be found
*where?*

There is also a C++-port of Ernst Heiri's Calamaris available. It is
(according to the author Jens-S. Voeckler <voeckler@rvs.uni-hannover.de>) five
times faster than the Perl-variant.  check
http://www.cache.dfn.de/DFN-Cache/Development/seafood.html for this.
