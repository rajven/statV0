What will happen next?
----------------------

I think that Calamaris v3 is nearly finished. (except for bugs, that maybe were
not found yet.)

But if you have an idea what is still missing in a software for parsing proxy
log-files, let me know. --> <Calamaris@Cord.de>. I'll will build it in, or add
it to the wish-list below :-)

* adding a Makefile or some other installation-routine, so fixing lib-paths
  isn't nessecary anymore. (Help wanted)

* I suggest that the '-P' option has a <number of lines> option, like all
  other analyses. So the time step would be something like = <analysis time> /
  <number of lines>. (Ahmad Kamal <eng_ak@link.net>) Comment: As I cumulate
  the Performance-Data in the Mainloop, when i don't know which timerange i
  get, i don't have <analysis time> at the time i'd need it, so i don't think
  that i can implement this without a major rewrite.

* rewrite peak-measurement. The new calculation method is very time intensive
  and slows down Calamaris by 30 or more percent, but it is faster than the
  old way. However: i'm not really satisfied with it, so i put it out of the
  -a -option. You'll have to add a '-p (old|new)' -option to get old or new
  peak-statistic.

  HELP REQUEST: If someone has an idea how to build an efficient AND fast
  method to work it out... let me know!

* try 'use integer'. This can result in a less memory-hungry, but faster
  version of Calamaris. (idea by Gerold Meerkoetter)

* make Calamaris faster. see above. If someone wants to rewrite Calamaris in a
  faster language: Feel Free! (But respect the GNU-License) It would be nice
  if you drop me a line about it, I'll mention it in the README. And please
  please please don't use the name 'Calamaris' for it without asking me!
